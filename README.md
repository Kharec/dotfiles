# dotfiles

This repository contains my dotfiles and stuff I'd like to keep between my machines.

Everything should work as expected on macOS.

## Requirements

- [Helix text editor](https://helix-editor.com/)
- [skhd hotkey daemon](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd)
- [yabai wm](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai)
- [Kitty terminal emulator](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/)
- [Zellij](https://zellij.dev/)

## How to use

Technically, you just have to take the config file(s) and drop it under the right folder (oftenly `~/.config`).

`dot_config` stands for `.config`, and so on.

## License

MIT License, short so read it.
